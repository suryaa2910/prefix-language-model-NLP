# prefix-language-model-NLP
Problem Statement: Develop a prefix language model using Hugging Face and PyTorch. You can pick any dataset for a creative text generation task and you should report the perplexity metric. Hint: A subtle data preprocessing trick is required when setting the inputs and labels for implementing prefix LM.

Model Selected: t5-large

Dataset Selected: CNN daily mail
